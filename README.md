# Tic Tac Toe 2.0  🎮
A creative twist on the classic Tic Tac Toe game, built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. In this version, each player can only have **3 marks on the board** at a time — once a fourth move is made, the **oldest mark disappears**, adding a fun layer of strategy!

## 🔥 Features

- ✨ **3-Move Limit**  
  Players can only have 3 active marks. Placing a 4th will remove the oldest one automatically.

- 🔍 **Move Preview**  
  A subtle highlight shows which mark will vanish next, helping players plan ahead.

- 🤖 **AI Opponent with Minimax Algorithm**  
  The AI:
  - Evaluates all possible moves using the Minimax algorithm
  - Assigns scores to different outcomes
  - Adapts to the dynamic 3-mark rule
  - Makes smart choices to win or force a draw

- 🎮 **Multiple Game Modes**  
  - **Player vs Player**
  - **Player vs AI**

First to get 3 in a row **(horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)** wins!
